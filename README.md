# my-lua-ui-bits
Bits i've made as a newbie lua coder to facilitate a ui in love2d programs.

The examples button-example and entry-example display their usage. (todo: commit examples)

These ui bits are subject to a lot of change, almost every new test program has caused changes.

Hmm, new issue: web player like the one at https://schellingb.github.io/LoveWebBuilder/run-project
  doesn't work with my entry-example.love but an older version of entry.lua that still used the
  callback love.keypressed() does work on a webpage.  May need to continue with that version instead
  for more portability...
