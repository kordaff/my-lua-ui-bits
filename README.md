# my-lua-ui-bits
Bits i've made as a newbie lua coder to facilitate a ui in love2d programs.

So far all I have is a button widget and an entry widget, both pretty simple.
The buttons rely on being made visible, probably in function love.load()
and being called in function love.draw()

```lua


b.visible=true


```
